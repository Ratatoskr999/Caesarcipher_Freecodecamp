Vigenere Cipher 
A classic method of encrypting alphabetic text using a keyword-based substitution technique
The Vigen√®re cipher is a method of encrypting text by applying a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. This project demonstrates how to encode and decode messages using this technique, with a focus on clarity, modularity, and ease of use.
